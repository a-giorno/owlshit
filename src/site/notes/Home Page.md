>[!owls] Our Mission
Our mission is to create a workplace where all staff are empowered to support WGU’s fundamental purpose: to serve our students. Utilizing collective bargaining, we will  advocate for equitable working conditions, secure fair wages and benefits, and uphold and promote worker’s rights. We do this to honor our core belief that education has the ability to change someone’s life by creating pathways to opportunity.
